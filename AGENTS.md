# AGENTS.md

## Overview
`dev-vault` is a Go CLI that pulls/pushes Scaleway Secret Manager `*-dev` secrets to disk for local development workflows.

Configuration is per-project via a committed `.scw.json` manifest that maps secret names to local file paths relative to the project root.

This file documents project conventions and hard constraints for contributors and automation/agents.

## Hard Safety Rules
- Never print secret payloads (to stdout/stderr, logs, or error messages).
- Refuse to operate on any secret name that does not end with `-dev` (this is an invariant, not a convention).
- Do not commit credentials, tokens, or real secret identifiers into the repository (including README examples).
- If a secret/token is ever pasted into chat/logs, treat it as compromised and rotate/revoke immediately.

## Common Commands
- Install: `go install github.com/bsmartlabs/dev-vault/cmd/dev-vault@latest`
- Test (100% coverage required): `go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out`
- Coverage summary: `go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -n 1`
- Run help: `go run ./cmd/dev-vault -h`

## `.scw.json` Notes (v1)
- File name is fixed: `.scw.json`.
- Discovery: the CLI searches upward from the current working directory until it finds `.scw.json` (or pass `--config <path>`).
- The directory containing `.scw.json` is the "project root"; all `mapping.*.file` paths are relative to that root.
- `mapping` keys:
  - Are Scaleway secret names.
  - Must end in `-dev` (hard enforced).
- `mapping[*].format`:
  - `raw`: secret bytes are written as-is.
  - `dotenv`: secret payload is expected to be a JSON object; it is rendered deterministically as a `.env` style file.
- `mapping[*].mode`:
  - `both` (default): eligible for both `pull --all` and `push --all`.
  - `pull`: only eligible for `pull --all`.
  - `push`: only eligible for `push --all`.
  - Legacy: `sync` is accepted as an alias for `both`.

## CI Local Runs (GitHub Actions via `act`)
- Test job: `act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -j test`
- Build job: `act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -j build`
- Apple Silicon: add `--container-architecture linux/arm64`

## CI (GitHub Actions)
- `ci` runs on:
  - `pull_request` (all PRs, including Renovate PRs)
  - `push` to `main` only
- The CI pipeline gates with:
  - gitleaks scan (downloads the latest gitleaks release at runtime)
  - `go test` with 100.0% statement coverage enforced
  - multi-arch build smoke test (`linux/darwin/windows`, `amd64/arm64` where applicable)

## Homebrew Tap Update
Publishing is done on Git tags (`v*`) via GoReleaser, and the release workflow attempts to update the Homebrew tap formula.

Tap update requires `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` to have write access to `bsmartlabs/homebrew-dev-tools`.

Manual tap update can be done with `scripts/update-homebrew-formula.sh` after a GitHub release exists with `checksums.txt`:

```bash
scripts/update-homebrew-formula.sh \
  --repo bsmartlabs/dev-vault \
  --tag v1.2.3 \
  --tap bsmartlabs/homebrew-dev-tools \
  --token "$HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

## Releases
- Release workflow trigger: pushing a tag matching `v*`.
- Weekly auto-tagging exists as a workflow, but scheduled runs are disabled by default:
  - Set repo variable `DEV_VAULT_ENABLE_SCHEDULED_RELEASES=true` to enable scheduled tagging.
  - `workflow_dispatch` can also be used to create a tag explicitly.

## Renovate
- Renovate is enabled (`renovate.json`) and configured to automerge safe updates when CI is green.
- Avoid introducing workflow triggers that run on every branch push; keep `push` workflows limited to `main` to avoid Renovate noise/cost.

name: desloppify
description: >
  Codebase health scanner and technical debt tracker. Use when the user asks
  about code quality, technical debt, dead code, large files, god classes,
  duplicate functions, code smells, naming issues, import cycles, or coupling
  problems. Also use when asked for a health score, what to fix next, or to
  create a cleanup plan. Supports 28 languages.

# Desloppify

## 1. Your Job

Improve code quality by maximising the **strict score** honestly.

**The main thing you do is run `desloppify next`** — it tells you exactly what to fix and how. Fix it, resolve it, run `next` again. Keep going.

Follow the scan output's **INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENTS** — don't substitute your own analysis.

## 2. The Workflow

Two loops. The **outer loop** rescans periodically to measure progress.
The **inner loop** is where you spend most of your time: fixing issues one by one.

### Outer loop — scan and check

```bash
desloppify scan --path .       # analyse the codebase
desloppify status              # check scores — are we at target?
```
If not at target, work the inner loop. Rescan periodically — especially after clearing a cluster or batch of related fixes. Issues cascade-resolve and new ones may surface.

### Inner loop — fix issues

Repeat until the queue is clear:

```
1. desloppify next              ← tells you exactly what to fix next
2. Fix the issue in code
3. Resolve it (next shows you the exact command including required attestation)
```

Score may temporarily drop after fixes — cascade effects are normal, keep going.
If `next` suggests an auto-fixer, run `desloppify fix <fixer> --dry-run` to preview, then apply.

**To be strategic**, use `plan` to shape what `next` gives you:
```bash
desloppify plan                        # see the full ordered queue
desloppify plan move <pat> top         # reorder — what unblocks the most?
desloppify plan cluster create <name>  # group related issues to batch-fix
desloppify plan focus <cluster>        # scope next to one cluster
desloppify plan defer <pat>            # push low-value items aside
desloppify plan skip <pat>             # hide from next
desloppify plan done <pat>             # mark complete
desloppify plan reopen <pat>           # reopen
```

### Subjective reviews

The scan will prompt you when a subjective review is needed — just follow its instructions.
If you need to trigger one manually:
```bash
desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel --scan-after-import
```

### Other useful commands

```bash
desloppify next --count 5                         # top 5 priorities
desloppify next --cluster <name>                  # drill into a cluster
desloppify show <pattern>                         # filter by file/detector/ID
desloppify show --status open                     # all open findings
desloppify plan skip --permanent "<id>" --note "reason" # accept debt (lowers strict score)
desloppify scan --path . --reset-subjective       # reset subjective baseline to 0
```

## 3. Reference

### How scoring works

Overall score = **40% mechanical** + **60% subjective**.

- **Mechanical (40%)**: auto-detected issues — duplication, dead code, smells, unused imports, security. Fixed by changing code and rescanning.
- **Subjective (60%)**: design quality review — naming, error handling, abstractions, clarity. Starts at **0%** until reviewed. The scan will prompt you when a review is needed.
- **Strict score** is the north star: wontfix items count as open. The gap between overall and strict is your wontfix debt.
- **Score types**: overall (lenient), strict (wontfix counts), objective (mechanical only), verified (confirmed fixes only).

### Subjective reviews in detail

- **Preferred**: `desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel --scan-after-import` — does everything in one command.
- **Manual path**: `desloppify review --prepare` → review per dimension → `desloppify review --import file.json`.
- Import first, fix after — import creates tracked state entries for correlation.
- Integrity: reviewers score from evidence only. Scores hitting exact targets trigger auto-reset.
- Even moderate scores (60-80) dramatically improve overall health.
- Stale dimensions auto-surface in `next` — just follow the queue.

### Key concepts

- **Tiers**: T1 auto-fix → T2 quick manual → T3 judgment call → T4 major refactor.
- **Auto-clusters**: related findings are auto-grouped in `next`. Drill in with `next --cluster <name>`.
- **Zones**: production/script (scored), test/config/generated/vendor (not scored). Fix with `zone set`.
- **Wontfix cost**: widens the lenient↔strict gap. Challenge past decisions when the gap grows.
- Score can temporarily drop after fixes (cascade effects are normal).

## 4. Escalate Tool Issues Upstream

When desloppify itself appears wrong or inconsistent:

1. Capture a minimal repro (`command`, `path`, `expected`, `actual`).
2. Open a GitHub issue in `peteromallet/desloppify`.
3. If you can fix it safely, open a PR linked to that issue.
4. If unsure whether it is tool bug vs user workflow, issue first, PR second.

## Prerequisite

`command -v desloppify >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "desloppify: installed" || echo "NOT INSTALLED — run: pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/peteromallet/desloppify.git"`

## Codex Overlay

This is the canonical Codex overlay used by the README install command.

1. Prefer first-class batch runs: `desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel --scan-after-import`.
2. The command writes immutable packet snapshots under `.desloppify/review_packets/holistic_packet_*.json`; use those for reproducible retries.
3. Keep reviewer input scoped to the immutable packet and the source files named in each batch.
4. Do not use prior chat context, score history, narrative summaries, issue labels, or target-threshold anchoring while scoring.
5. Assess every dimension listed in `query.dimensions`; never drop a requested dimension. If evidence is weak/mixed, score lower and explain uncertainty in findings.
6. Return machine-readable JSON only for review imports. For Claude session submit (`--external-submit`), include `session` from the generated template:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "<session_id_from_template>",
    "token": "<session_token_from_template>"
  },
  "assessments": {
    "<dimension_from_query>": 0
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "dimension": "<dimension_from_query>",
      "identifier": "short_id",
      "summary": "one-line defect summary",
      "related_files": ["relative/path/to/file.py"],
      "evidence": ["specific code observation"],
      "suggestion": "concrete fix recommendation",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ]
}
```

7. `findings` MUST match `query.system_prompt` exactly (including `related_files`, `evidence`, and `suggestion`). Use `"findings": []` when no defects are found.
8. Import is fail-closed by default: if any finding is invalid/skipped, `desloppify review --import` aborts unless `--allow-partial` is explicitly passed.
9. Assessment scores are auto-applied from trusted internal run-batches imports, or via Claude cloud session imports (`desloppify review --external-start --external-runner claude` then printed `--external-submit`). Legacy attested external import via `--attested-external` remains supported.
10. Manual override is safety-scoped: you cannot combine it with `--allow-partial`, and provisional manual scores expire on the next `scan` unless replaced by trusted internal or attested-external imports.
11. If a batch fails, retry only that slice with `desloppify review --run-batches --packet <packet.json> --only-batches <idxs>`.
